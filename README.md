🩺 Diabetes Predictor

Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning and Flask Web Application.

This project aims to predict whether a patient is affected by diabetes based on important health parameters such as Glucose Level, Insulin, BMI, and Age.

The complete machine learning pipeline is implemented in this project, starting from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Multiple machine learning algorithms are evaluated using accuracy as the performance metric, and the best-performing model is selected.

Finally, the trained model is deployed as a local web application using Flask, allowing users to input medical values and receive predictions in real time.
